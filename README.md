Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide,
representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem 
in today’s society.


This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer. 
The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. The early diagonsis of BC can improvethe chance of survival significantly.  
Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. 
Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. 
Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of 
choice in BC pattern classification and forecast modelling.



We will use the UCI Machine Learning Repository for breast cancer dataset.

Attribute Information:
1) ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3–32)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
1.radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
2.texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
3.perimeter
4.area
5.smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
6.compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
7.concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
8.concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9.symmetry
10.fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest which is actually the mean of the three largest values of these features were computed for each image,
 resulting in 30 features.


This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends 
that may aid us in model selection and hyper parameter selection. The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant.
